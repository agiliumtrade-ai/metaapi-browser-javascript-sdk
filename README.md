# metaapi.cloud SDK for browser javascript
MetaApi is a powerful, fast, cost-efficient, easy to use and standards-driven cloud forex trading API for MetaTrader 4 and MetaTrader 5 platform designed for traders, investors and forex application developers to boost forex application development process. MetaApi can be used with any broker and does not require you to be a brokerage.

CopyFactory is a simple yet powerful copy-trading API which is a part of MetaApi. See below for CopyFactory readme section.

MetaApi is a paid service, but API access to one MetaTrader account is free of charge.

The [MetaApi pricing](https://metaapi.cloud/#pricing) was developed with the intent to make your charges less or equal to what you would have to pay
for hosting your own infrastructure. This is possible because over time we managed to heavily optimize
our MetaTrader infrastructure. And with MetaApi you can save significantly on application development and
maintenance costs and time thanks to high-quality API, open-source SDKs and convenience of a cloud service.

Official REST and websocket API documentation: [https://metaapi.cloud/docs/client/](https://metaapi.cloud/docs/client/)

Please note that this SDK provides an abstraction over REST and websocket API to simplify your application logic.
